# Setup
### Description
Setup development with **Rusted Script** on your computer.

## Generic Shell Environment
If you wish to experience and analyze how Rusted-Script can accomplish, you can run the shell-like environment below. (Requires Python3)
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/Rusted-Script/Rusted-Script.git
cd Rusted-Script
cd src
python3 shell.py
```

## Linux

Rusted-Script has Native binaries for Linux-GNU systems. It's as simple as just running `./Linux_Installer.sh`. This will install the binaries for you. After that, go to `/binary/Linux` and run, `./rusted run {Path_to_rusted_file}`(Must contain full path to file).
 
 ## Windows
 Sadly. Rusted-Script doesn't provide native binaries for Windows systems. Meaning you will need to run the interpreter manually.
 ```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rusted-Script/Rusted-Script.git
cd Rusted-Script
cd src
python3 main.py run {Path_to_rusted_file}
```
## MacOS
Not available


## Example of Rusted Script code

# Rusted Script syntax

if x == 3 then 123 elif x == 0 then 321 else 12345
```
